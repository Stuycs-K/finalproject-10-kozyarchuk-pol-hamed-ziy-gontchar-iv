Work from 5/15 - 5/23
- Didn't know we were supposed to be logging research so this is a little late but here goes. Spent A LOT of time trying to understand how the hell this machine is able to function.
- Found this emulator almost instantly and it is quite useful for visualizing the steps in between encryption: https://www.101computing.net/enigma-machine-emulator/
- Had another 3d version we played around with but that was too complex, so we turned to something like this instead: https://cryptii.com/pipes/enigma-machine
- This one is SO COOL in the visualization but has given us at least one wrong output that differs from other sites (though most other inputs were correct): https://observablehq.com/@tmcw/enigma-machine
- This website had a very good and detailed reading explanation of the inner workings of the machine: https://www.ciphermachinesandcryptology.com/en/enigmatech.htm
- This site is also pretty good for general information on the machine, perhaps not as detailed though: https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/working.htm
- Wiki where we got the rotor configurations from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_rotor_details
- THIS YOUTUBE VIDEO WAS PROBABLY THE CLICK POINT FOR ME: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybkkiGtJmkM&pp=ygUOZW5pZ21hIG1hY2hpbmU%3D
- Revisited this video from the Perusall but found it didn't have as much technical info; I prefer the above one far more but it's still fine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2_Q9FoD-oQ&pp=ygUOZW5pZ21hIG1hY2hpbmU%3D
- Spent a lot of time playing around trying to figure out where the steps went and how they got there
- Abstract plans for code process and visualization elements

Work from 5/28
- Spent more time running through cases, and realized the most fatal error was probably the rotor wheels on the sites being weirdly configured, but once I realized how I should have put it, I genuinely understood how it works and what we must start doing to have it work. Starting to see code plan in my mind
- Updated the readme with pretty much as much info as we could have
