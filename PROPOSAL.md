# Intentions:

A statement of the problem you are solving and/or a high level description of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

We plan to develop an Enigma machine visualizer. It would work the same way the original machine worked -- simply type in the message you want to encode, and the ciphertext will show up. At the end, the UI will show which position the rotors are at, where the plugs are, and allow the user to change them.
    
# Intended usage:
