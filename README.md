# Enigma Machine Visualization

### GROUP NAME HERE (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

Ivan Gontchar, Ziyad Hamed, Polina Kozyarchuk

### Project Description:

Enigma machine emulator.
=======
Our project will feature a functioning encoding and decoding mechanism for the (in)famous Enigma Machine, that was used by Nazi Germany as a method of encryption during World War 2. Users will be able to customize the machine's settings (rotors, rotor positions, rotor settings, plugboard, possibly reflectors) to their liking. Users will then be able to encrypt or decrypt messages that they choose to type in as a prompt. Our program will feature a loosely guided walkthrough in a Processing window to show the progression of the encoding for the message, to eventually arrive at the final product, such that users understand what happened.

### Instructions:

To run the program, start with copying the repo and running the sketch. You will be prompted for user input. Type in the requested information. 
After the program starts, type in input characters. The program will show you the process of how the input goes through the rotors and plugboard, and what the final output is.
