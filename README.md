# Enigma Machine Visualization

### GROUP NAME HERE (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

Ivan Gontchar, Ziyad Hamed, Polina Kozyarchuk

### Project Description:

Enigma machine emulator.
=======
Our project will feature a functioning encoding and decoding mechanism for the (in)famous Enigma Machine, that was used by Nazi Germany as a method of encryption during World War 2. Users will be able to customize the machine's settings (rotors, rotor positions, rotor settings, plugboard, possibly reflectors) to their liking. Users will then be able to encrypt or decrypt messages that they choose to type in as a prompt. Our program will feature a loosely guided walkthrough in a Processing window to show the progression of the encoding for the message, to eventually arrive at the final product, such that users understand what happened.

### Instructions:

#### Install
To install the program all you need to do is clone the repo and its processing files.

#### Run
To run the application simply use the command `processing-java --sketch=enigma --run` in the folder containing the processing sketch. If the repo was cloned, then the folder would be the repo folder.

**Note**

In some instances, simply using the relative path of the sketch, in this case, *enigma* may not properly pick up the fodler, if that's the case use the full path from the drive as the argument for sketch. (This was the case on some of our windows machines)
