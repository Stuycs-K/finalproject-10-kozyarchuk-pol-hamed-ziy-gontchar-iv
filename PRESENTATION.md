### Enigma Machine Emulator

## Intro:

## What it was - some history (Polina):
![enigma machine image](https://github.com/Stuycs-K/finalproject-10-kozyarchuk-pol-hamed-ziy-gontchar-iv/blob/main/enigma/image_2025-06-04_073958274.png)

- It was created in WW2 by by Arthur Scherbius, and was used by the Nazis to encode messages.
- The large number of combinations with rotor settings, rotor combinations, and the plugboard led to what made the machine so unbreakable, which was 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 (quintillion) different combinations.
- The machine was broken because the Nazis would repeat certain phrases often in their messages, such as weather reports or "Heil Hitler".
- The signal for the letter goes through the input, into the plugboard, through the rotors, reflected in the reflector, and then back through the rotors, then plugboard, and finally lighting up the encoded letter.

## Running our program (Ivan)
- All you have to do is run "processing-java --sketch=enigma --run".
- Next, follow the user input guidelines to configure all the settings you want.
- Finally just type in your input and watch the visualization happen.

## The Visualization (Ziyad)
Visualization:
- To follow the visualization, user the arrows, but also we can see that yellow is for the first round of the process, and red is when it goes back around.
